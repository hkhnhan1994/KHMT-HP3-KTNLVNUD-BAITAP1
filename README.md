# Google Search and GitHub Link Extraction

This Python script performs Google searches for paragraphs stored in a text file and extracts the first GitHub link from the search results. If no GitHub link is found, it returns "not found".

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install googlesearch-python
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. Create a text file (e.g., `paragraphs.txt`) and store the paragraphs to search, each separated by one or more occurrences of double newline characters.

2. Run the Python script `find_github.py`:

```bash
python find_github.py
```

3. The script will perform Google searches for each paragraph and extract the first GitHub link from the search results.

4. The results will be displayed in a pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file named `result.csv`.

## Contents

- `find_github.py`: The main Python script that performs the Google searches and extracts GitHub links.
- `paragraphs.txt`: Example text file containing paragraphs to search.
- `result.csv`: CSV file containing the search results.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

## Customization

- Modify `paragraphs.txt` with your own paragraphs to search.
- Customize the script for different search queries or data sources as needed.

## Notes

- Web scraping might be against the terms of service of certain websites, so use this code responsibly and ensure that you are not violating any website policies.
- Be mindful of using any library or code that may lead to excessive requests or potential misuse.
